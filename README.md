# Home Automation Dashboard

This is a home automation dashboard created for the University of Pennsylvania CIS 197 final project. The inspiration for the dashboard came from my ongoing project of creating a fully customizable home assistant with an emphasis on user privacy.

# Features

  - User Management with clearance levels (Admin, Resident, and Guest)
  - MongoDB Room and Device management
  - Built in MQTT client for directly controlling existing home automation systems
  - Built in plots for monitoring home sensors (currently doesn't pull in data from InfluxDB)
